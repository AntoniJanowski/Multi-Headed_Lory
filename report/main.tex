% Transformers have become a cornerstone in natural language processing, driving advances in tasks such as machine translation and text generation. The Transformer architecture revolutionized language modeling by enabling parallel information integration across sequences. Improving the attention mechanism is challenging due to its complexity, so researchers often focus on modifying the MLP layer to optimize performance. One of the most crucial advancements was Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) which allows models to scale up significantly in parameter size without proportionate increases in training or inference costs. Despite these advancements, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models continue to encounter challenges related to their non-differentiable discrete routing mechanisms and the under-utilization of certain experts. Recent research has concentrated on resolving these issues. This study aims to integrate the strengths of two of these recent innovations in the MoE layer, Multi-Head Mixture-of-Experts (MH-MoE) and Lory, into a unified framework to harness the benefits of both approaches.
%wersja Michala:
Recently, two different MoE architecture improvements were introduced: (1) Lory (\cite{zhong2024lory}), which efficiently scales a fully differentiable MoE architecture to autoregressive language modeling pretraining, and (2) MH-MoE (\cite{wu2024multihead}), which employs a multi-head mechanism to split tokens into subtokens that are processed in parallel before being reintegrated, allowing for more fine-grained analytical capabilities. In this paper, we present MH-Lory, the first architecture combining both of these advancements. 

Experimental results suggest that our model achieves a slight improvement over the original Lory while maintaining all its benefits. Our work highlights the potential of merging Lory and MH-MoE architectures and encourages further investigation of this issue with more computational resources.

\section{Introduction}
The Transformer architecture (\cite{vaswani2017attention}) introduced a parallelizable method to combine information from distant parts of sequences, allowing for effective language modeling. It was further improved by the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) approach (\cite{shazeer2017outrageously}), which enabled the training of models with significantly more parameters without a substantial increase in training or inference costs. However, due to non-differentiable discrete routing mechanisms, such as top-k expert-activation routing, MoE faces challenges in learning effective routing strategies (\cite{muqeeth2023soft}). It also suffers from low expert activation and lacks fine-grained capabilities to analyze multiple semantic concepts within individual tokens (\cite{wu2024multihead}).

Recently, several works have attempted to address the non-differentiability of expert choice in the MoE architecture (\cite{Puigcerver2023FromST}, \cite{muqeeth2023soft}). In (\cite{muqeeth2023soft}), each token is processed by a "merged expert," whose parameters are a sum of experts' parameters weighted uniquely for every token according to the router. This operation is differentiable but increases computational complexity and memory requirements, scaling linearly with the number of experts, which makes it impractical for autoregressive tasks. This problem is mitigated by Lory (\cite{zhong2024lory}), which recomputes the "merged expert" only once per segment (comprising a few hundred tokens) instead of for each token, while avoiding information leakage.

A related problem of low expert activation is addressed by Multi-Head Mixture-of-Experts (MH-MoE) (\cite{wu2024multihead}). It also addresses the lack of fine-grained capabilities to analyze multiple semantic concepts within individual tokens. MH-MoE achieves this by splitting tokens into sub-tokens (corresponding to the number of "heads") and then assigning and processing these sub-tokens in parallel with experts before reintegrating them. The naming convention resembles that of multi-head attention, though it is worth noting that the number of heads in these two parts does not need to be related.

In this work, we propose to apply both techniques within a single architecture: combining Lory (\cite{zhong2024lory}) and Multi-Head Mixture-of-Experts (MH-MoE) (\cite{wu2024multihead}). We introduce a novel MoE architecture, MH-Lory, that is fully differentiable and enables fine-grained analysis of different semantic meanings for each token. MH-Lory is a Lory baseline with the addition of heads, as precisely described in section 3 of this paper.



\section{Related work}

\subsection{MH-MoE} 
In (Sparse) MoE (\cite{shazeer2017outrageously}) that is a baseline for authors of MH-MoE each MoE block consists of $E$ independent feed forward networks [FFNs] called Experts (which we denote as $e_i$) and a gating function (router), $g$, used to calculate weights over these experts' outputs, with k of them (activated according to top-k gated values) processing any token. That is for any input token's hidden representation $h \in \mathbb{R}^d$, output of the MoE block is computed as follows:

\[ \text{output}(h)=h+\sum_{i=1}^{i=k} e_i (h)  \cdot g(h, e_i)\]

MH-MoE uses a multi-head mechanism to split each input token into sub-tokens, then processes them in parallel by diverse experts, and then reintegrates them into the original token form. Let us denote number of heads as $H$ and token's hidden representation $h \in \mathbb{R}^d $ split into $H$ sub-tokens as $h_1,h_2,...,h_H \in \mathbb{R}^{\frac{d}{H}} $. Then given $p$-th sub-token the output of the MH-MoE block would be computed as:

\[ \text{output}(h_p)= h_p + \sum_{i=1}^{i=k} e_i (h_p)  \cdot g(h_p,e_i)\]

Additionally before splitting tokens they are multiplied by "multi-head projection" matrix, similarly they are multiplied by "merge" matrix after reintegration.

Thanks to this technique the average volume of data routed to a specific expert is increased by a factor of $H$.
Moreover, while current tokenization patterns limit a model's ability to capture multiple semantic interpretations of tokens, MH-MoE enables capturing information from diverse feature spaces across these experts (\cite{wu2024multihead}).


\subsection{Lory}
In Lory architecture (\cite{zhong2024lory}) authors aim to create a fully differentiable and computationally feasible MoE. To process a sequence of $L$ tokens, with hidden representations $h_1, h_2, \dots h_L$ it is divided into $N$ segments of length $T = \frac{L}{N}$. Each segment will be processed by a single "merged expert" that is created based on the information from the previous segment. Let's suppose that we currently want to start to process segment $k>1$ (so we want to process tokens $h_k, h_{k+1}\dots ,h_{k+T -1}$, while previous segment consisted of tokens $h_{k - T}, h_{k-T+1}\dots ,h_{k-1}$). Assuming that a Lory block has $E$ feed-forward expert networks, each parameterised by weights $\theta_i$ its output is calculated as follows:
\[\text{output}(h_{k + j}) = (h_{k + j} + \text{FFN}(h_{k+j}, \sum_{i=1}^E \theta_i w_i) \text{,   where  } w_i = \text{Softmax}(g(\frac{1}{T}\sum_{q = 0}^{T-1}h_{k-T+q}), e_i)\] where $\text{FFN}(a, b)$ means an expert (feed-forward networks) with weights $b$ applied to input $a$ and $g$ the gating function (router).
For processing the first segment, the authors propose to create an expert matrix by using all tokens from the first segment, and adding a stop gradient operation on top of the router.
This approach allows to compute weighted sum of experts only once per segment making it suitable for auto-regressive tasks. It prevents information leakage and keeps the causal nature of the model.
At inference the prompt is used to calculate one merged expert used throughout generation. 

The authors also used similarity-based data batching technique introduced by (\cite{shi2023context}). 
It ensures that batches contain similar documents, so even when one document ends and other start inside one segment, routing decision made based on the previous document can still be relevant to the next document, which enhances expert specialization in later layers.



\section{Our architecture: MH-Lory}
Both Lory and MH-MoE report promising gains in performance, while using techniques that we believe can be beneficially combined into MH-Lory. 

Combining Lory and MH-MoE architectures admittedly poses a challenge as their strategies aren't orthogonal but diverge slightly. Lory achieves full activation of experts by merging them in pursue of full differentiability. Keeping this feature in the MH-Lory makes one of two advantages of MH-MoE irrelevant as introducing heads can't increase expert activation further. What's more, in Lory whole segments are processed by the same "merged expert" while MH-MoE goes in different direction, routing mere parts of tokens to different experts. Thus Lory decreases the variability of assigned experts between tokens compared to traditional MoE while MH-MoE does the opposite.

The hope is to make an improvement on Lory by reaping the rewards of allowing more fine-grained understanding of multiple semantic concepts within a token as happens in MH-MoE. As an additional benefit by introducing expert heads to Lory architecture we decrease the number of parameters per expert allowing to increase the number of experts. This allows for more diverse routing strategies and might increase expert specialization.

The most natural way to combine Lory and MH-MoE is to use the Lory model as a baseline and modify it by adding heads. More precisely, after the input is passed through the Multi-Head linear layer 
it's divided into $N$ segments of length $T=\frac{L}{N}$ and then further divide each token into $H$ sub-tokens where $H$ denotes the number of MH-Lory heads.
For each segment $n_i$ and for each head $h_j$, MH-Lory calculates the gating distribution over $E$ experts. This distribution is then used to create a unique merged expert, which is responsible for processing that particular head from the given segment. Finally, the tokens are reassembled into their original shape and passed through the linear Merging layer. Similar to MH-MoE, the Multi-head layer and the Merging layer ensure that information from a token is effectively divided into sub-tokens and then accurately merged back together.

For an input token $t_k$, assuming that MH-Lory block has $E$ feed-forward expert networks, each parameterised by weights $\theta_i$ its output is computed as follows:

\[\text{output}(t_k) = \text{Merge-Layer}(\text{Concatenation}(t_k^1, \dots t_k^H))\] 

where

\[t_k^i =  \text{FFN}(s_k^i, \sum_{i=1}^E \theta_i w_i)\]

and

\[s_k^1,\dots, s_k^H = \text{Divide}(\text{Multi-Head-Layer}(t_k))\]

and

\[w_i = \text{Softmax}(g(A))\]

where A represents the avarage embeding of the sub-tokens coresponding to a given head from previous segment, $g$ represents the Router gating function and Divide is the operation of spliting a token into $H$ sub tokens along the hidden dimension.

\section{Experiments}
Our main goal was to compare four MoE Transformer models: Lory, (Sparse) MoE, MH-MoE and MH-Lory, our architecture, in terms of perplexity on a language modelling task with equal number of parameters. We also compare the inference and training efficiency of these models.

\label{tab:hyperparams_table}
\end{table}
The number of heads is specific to the MH-MoE and MH-Lory models, affecting their ability to attend to multiple positions simultaneously. The number of segments $T$ is a unique parameter for the Lory and MH-Lory models, determining the sequence's segmentation granularity. 
The load balancing coefficient $\alpha$ and capacity factor $c$ play crucial roles in distributing computational load among experts. 
For MoE and MH-MoE models, the training loss is a sum of a primary cross-entropy loss related to the target task (only this loss is logged) and an auxiliary load balancing loss (\cite{wu2024multihead}). The load balancing loss is computed as follows:
\[ L_{balance} = \frac{N}{|\ddot{X}|} \sum_{p=1}^{N} \sum_{x_i^j \in \ddot{X}} t_p \cdot g(f_p^{FFN}) \]
where $N$ denotes the number of experts, $|\ddot{X}|$ is the number of sub-tokens contained in $\ddot{X}$. $g(f_p^{FFN})$ is the value of routing a certain sub-token $x_{i,j}$ into the $p^{th}$ expert.


\subsection{Experimental Set-up}
Constrained by limited computational resources we trained and validated the aforementioned models on the pre-processed "20220301.simple" subset from Wikipedia dataset (\cite{wikidump}).
The dataset was partitioned using an 80-10-10 train-validation-test split. Each model was trained for 10 epochs using Cross-Entropy loss and the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate of $0.006$, betas set to $(0.9, 0.95)$, and a batch size of 20. In each model we used a BERT tokenizer (\cite{devlin2018bert}) with a vocabulary size of 30522 tokens. We also used a Rotary Positional Embedding (\cite{su2024roformer}) in each attention layer to capture the positional information in input sequences. For comparison purposes, the number of parameters in each model was standardized to 0.1 billion. The number of active parameters differs between the 4 models. In the Lory model all experts' embeddings are utilized during both the forward and backward passes as they are "merged" into weighted experts. This merging operation increses training times for both the Lory and MH-Lory models.

\section{Conclusions}

%TODO
Results of our experiments suggest that when it comes to perplexity MH-Lory achieves slightly better results than original Lory, although due to small size of the used dataset and length of training this isn't a conclusive result as all 4 models achieve comparable perplexity on the dataset we used. This uncertainty can be resolved by using much greater computational resources than those at our disposal.

Nevertheless our results suggest that the model performance doesn't suffer because of the combination of techniques that we propose. This encourages its further investigation as its performance potential may become visible only at greater scales, especially as theoretical considerations suggest that it should yield benefits over original Lory, which is the state of the art fully-differentiable architecture, as MH-Lory allows for greater number of experts and finer grained analysis capabilities of semantic concepts in individual token.

We leave it for a future research to test how these models scale, and whether they improve if the dataset is pre-processed using similarity-batching technique introduced by \cite{shi2023context}. We hope to pursue these questions in case of promising experiment results.

It may also be interesting to experiment with an alternative version (v2) of MH-Lory and compare it with the original (v1). In the alternative one (v2) each head would have a separate set of experts from which a "merged expert" is computed, instead of sharing one set of experts between all heads as in v1. Intuitively MH-Lory-v1 has advantage of increasing the number of examples (sub-tokens) per expert and having less parameters (there would be $N \cdot H$ experts in MH-Lory-v2 compared to $N$ experts in MH-Lory-v1). But on the other hand MH-Lory-v2 could allow for greater specialization of heads, potentially leading each head to focus on a particular aspect of token meaning.
